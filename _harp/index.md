My name is Slim. I am a computer scientist and 17th grade student at [UC Berkeley](https://cs.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Sarah Chasins](https://schasins.com/) under the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and UC Berkeley Chancellor’s Fellowship. I have also collaborated with [Ink & Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/) and [Notion](https://notion.so/about) during my PhD.

My research interests span programming languages, human factors, and learning sciences.
I study _programming languages as user interfaces_: in short, how the syntactic and semantic properties of a language shape the way people reason about and write programs in the real world. 
For instance, I ask questions about the usability of rich type systems, designing (co)algebraic abstractions for UI programming, and how different evaluation strategies might promote or hinder program comprehension in educational settings. My goal is to _meaningfully improve the state of practice_ via theoretically compelling formalisms, substantiated by rigorous empirical methods and user-centered design.

Previously I helped build tools for personal computing and collaboration at [Notion](https://notion.so/about); worked in the [Early Product Development](https://early.khanacademy.org/) group at [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org); and interned with the [Human Experience and Design](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/future-of-work/) group at [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/).

I received my BA in Computer Science from [Northwestern University](http://northwestern.edu), concentrating in human-computer interaction and theoretical computer science.
My studies were supported by scholarships from [Google](https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/scholarships/google-lime-scholarship/), [Microsoft](https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/usscholarshipprogram), [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/students/scholarship/wit-north-america/), [Box](http://www.boxdiversityscholarship.com/), [Quip](https://quip.com/scholarship), and others, for which I am grateful, though these companies do not necessarily represent my views.
During undergrad I was affiliated with the following research groups:

- [Design, Technology, and Research](http://dtr.northwestern.edu/), where I researched [CSS inspection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2dFxxBh2K4) with my co-advisors [Haoqi Zhang](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~hq) and [Nell O&rsquo;Rourke](http://www.eleanorourke.com). My work on [semantic dependencies in CSS inspection](assets/papers/ply-uist.pdf) was incorporated into the [Firefox Developer Tools](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/10/firefox-70-a-bountiful-release-for-all/#developertools) and received Best Paper Honorable Mention at [UIST 2018](https://uist.acm.org/uist2018/).
- [CS Theory Group](https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/), where I researched [peer grading algorithms](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1733860) with [Jason Hartline](https://sites.northwestern.edu/hartline).
- [Center for Connected Learning](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/), where I worked on [NetLogo Web](https://netlogoweb.org/) with [Jason Bertsche](https://github.com/TheBizzle).

Auxiliary interests include [browser engines](https://servo.org/), type systems, text editors, [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org), [crossword puzzles](https://twitter.com/soylentqueen/status/1002202872266874880), [document preparation](https://pandoc.org/), coiling and soldering custom USB cables, playing games on the Nintendo Switch, backpacking, jazz, and critical theory. I have also invested an outsized amount of time into several hobbies:

- I am a classically-trained flutist, currently studying with [Evan Pengra Sult](https://blogpnborg.wordpress.com/2020/12/14/letters-from-pnb-artists-evan-pengra-sult-pnb-orchestra-member/).
- I received my [Wilderness First Responder](https://www.wms.org/magazine/1176/WFR-Scope-Of-Practive) training through [NOLS](https://nols.edu/) and CPR training through the [AHA BLS course](https://cpr.heart.org/en/cpr-courses-and-kits/healthcare-professional/basic-life-support-bls-training), and am currently pursuing wilderness and urban EMT certification.
- My goal is to ride every Amtrak long-distance route with a West Coast terminus. So far I’ve taken the [California Zephyr](https://www.amtrak.com/routes/california-zephyr-train.html) twice, [Coast Starlight](https://www.amtrak.com/routes/coast-starlight-train.html) four times, and the [Sunset Limited](https://www.amtrak.com/routes/sunset-limited-train.html) and [Empire Builder](https://www.amtrak.com/routes/empire-builder-train.html) once each.
- Policy debate is a [niche](https://www.wired.com/2012/01/ff-debateteam/), [all-consuming](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2006/11/revenge-nerds/), and [occasionally-fraught](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/debatable) subculture that defined my adolescent and early adult identity. I founded the [Interlake Policy Debate](https://www.facebook.com/InterlakeDebate/) team, which continues to be nationally-successful [ten years later](https://scalar.usc.edu/works/sharksforever/), and was part of the [Northwestern Debate Society](https://communication.northwestern.edu/debate-society/) during our historic [15th national championship](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2015/04/northwestern-debate-society-wins-record-15th-title).

    Debate has shaped me profoundly, more than any other activity by far. Bootstrapping a high school team with no resources or coaching remains the hardest thing I have ever accomplished.

Here are a few of my 99 theses, and other topics I’ve written about:

- [Stop using “uni-typed” pejoratively to dunk on dynamically-typed languages](https://twitter.com/sliminality/status/1317331148360437760)
- [Chunking mathematical notation helps with understanding](https://twitter.com/sliminality/status/1409663659341619206)
- [I wish we understood why programmers have such poor intuitions about performance](https://twitter.com/sliminality/status/1313614499736297472)
- [Block vs. inline is a leaky and unintuitive abstraction for document editors](https://twitter.com/sliminality/status/1285324183413518337)
- [“Listening and learning” is the new “thoughts and prayers”](https://twitter.com/sliminality/status/1282736177305403392)
- [Code review should use a directed graph, not a linked list](https://twitter.com/sliminality/status/1275922682895192065)
- [Articulating injustice is more important than, but not mutually exclusive with, preserving your intellectual brand](https://twitter.com/sliminality/status/1267228511233667072)
- [Type errors are our friends and teachers](https://twitter.com/sliminality/status/1140838786043002881) (*and corollary:* [Better error messages help users conceptualize compilers as friendly guides rather than angry jerks](https://twitter.com/sliminality/status/1334654707575353345))
